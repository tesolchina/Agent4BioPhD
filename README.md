# Agent4BioPhD
A demonstration project showing how AI agents can automate text-based and programming tasks for academic research in biology.

## Overview

This repository demonstrates how AI agents can assist biology PhD students and researchers in various academic tasks, from brainstorming research questions to editing manuscripts. We use the Nature Reviews Genetics review article by Badia-i-Mompel et al. (2023) "[Gene regulatory network inference in the era of single-cell multi-omics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-023-00618-5)" as a starting point to explore different research automation scenarios.

## Key Features

This project showcases AI-assisted automation for:

- **Brainstorming**: Generate research questions, hypotheses, and experimental designs
- **Literature Review**: Automated paper summarization and knowledge extraction
- **Data Analysis**: Python scripts for bioinformatics and computational biology tasks
- **Writing Assistance**: Draft sections, improve clarity, and maintain consistency
- **Citation Management**: Organize and format references
- **Code Development**: Implement analysis pipelines and visualization tools
