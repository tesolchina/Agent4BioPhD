# Poster Abstract - November 7th Workshop

## AI Agents for Bioinformatics Research: Automating Literature Analysis and Computational Workflows

This workshop demonstrates how IDE-embedded AI agents can streamline bioinformatics research by integrating literature analysis with computational tasks. Using Badia-i-Mompel et al. (2023) on gene regulatory networks as a case study, participants will learn to automate systematic literature reviews with `litstudy` and perform transcription factor binding analysis using `motifmatchr`. The session shows how AI agents can read scientific papers, extract computational methods, and generate executable code within a unified environment, eliminating context-switching between reading and coding tasks.
