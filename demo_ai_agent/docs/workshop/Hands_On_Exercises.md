## Exercise 1: Literature to Code Translation

**Time**: 15-20 minutes  
**Difficulty**: ‚≠ê Beginner

### üìö Background
The Badia-i-Mompel et al. (2023) paper explains that GRN inference requires TF binding prediction. They list several motif matcher algorithms in Box 1.

### üéØ Your Goal
Understand how the biological concepts in the paper map to motifmatchr's implementation.

### üí° Starter Prompt
```
I'm reading Box 1 in Badia-i-Mompel et al 2023 about motif matcher 
algorithms. Help me connect the paper to motifmatchr:

1. What is the biological problem being solved?
2. How does motifmatchr's algorithm (MOODS) work conceptually?
3. The paper mentions different algorithms have different "modeling" 
   approaches - what does motifmatchr model differently from FIMO?
4. When would I choose motifmatchr over other options?

Include specific examples from both the paper and the code.
```

### ü§î Think About
- Why do we need computational prediction instead of just doing ChIP-seq for all TFs?
- What biological assumptions are we making when we use motif matching?
- What could cause false positives? False negatives?

### ‚úÖ Success Criteria
- [ ] You can explain the biological problem in your own words
- [ ] You understand the MOODS algorithm conceptually (don't need math details)
- [ ] You can list 2-3 strengths and weaknesses of motif matching
- [ ] You know when motifmatchr is the right tool choice

### üìù Reflection
Write 2-3 sentences: "Before this exercise I thought ___. Now I understand ___."

## Exercise 2: Parameter Detective

**Time**: 20-25 minutes  
**Difficulty**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê Intermediate

### üìö Background
The `matchMotifs()` function has several parameters: p-value threshold, background frequencies, PWM vs PFM, etc. These aren't arbitrary - they reflect biological reality.

### üéØ Your Goal
Understand what each parameter means biologically and how to choose appropriate values.

### üí° Starter Prompt
```
I need to understand motifmatchr parameters for my research. I'm 
analyzing ATAC-seq peaks from [YOUR CELL TYPE]. For each parameter, 
explain both the technical meaning AND biological interpretation:

1. p.cutoff (default 0.00005)
   - What does this represent biologically?
   - When would I use 0.0001 vs 0.00001?
   - What's the trade-off?

2. bg (background frequencies)
   - Why does this matter for my [GC-rich/AT-rich] regions?
   - Should I use "genome", "even", or custom?
   
3. PWMatrix vs PFMatrix input
   - What's the difference?
   - When does this choice matter?

4. Pseudocounts (in PWM conversion)
   - What are these for?
   - When would I change from default 0.8?

Give me a decision framework for each parameter based on common research scenarios.
```

### ü§î Think About
- If you're looking for rare pioneer TF binding events vs abundant TFs, how do parameters differ?
- How would your parameter choices differ for enhancer regions vs promoter regions?
- What if you're comparing across species with different GC content?

### ‚úÖ Success Criteria
- [ ] You can explain each parameter to a labmate
- [ ] You know when to deviate from defaults
- [ ] You understand the biological consequences of parameter choices
- [ ] You can justify your parameter choices for YOUR data

### üéì Advanced Challenge
Ask the agent: "Create a parameter selection quiz with 5 scenarios where I choose appropriate parameters and you explain if I'm right/wrong and why."

## Exercise 3: Design Your Own Workflow

**Time**: 30-40 minutes  
**Difficulty**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Advanced

### üìö Background
Real research requires integrating multiple steps: data QC, motif matching, statistical testing, biological filtering, interpretation.

### üéØ Your Goal
Design a complete workflow for a research question similar to yours.

### üí° Starter Prompt (Customize!)
```
I'm studying [YOUR BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM]. I have:
- scATAC-seq: [describe: # cells, # clusters/timepoints, conditions]
- scRNA-seq: [matched or separate?]
- Optional: [ChIP-seq, other data]

My research question: [e.g., "Which TFs drive cell fate X vs Y?"]

Help me design a complete workflow:

1. PLANNING:
   - What are the analysis steps from raw peaks to TF candidates?
   - What tools/databases do I need?
   - What are potential pitfalls in my specific case?

2. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:
   - Should I use pseudobulk or single-cell level analysis?
   - Which motif database for [my organism]?
   - How to define "background" peaks for enrichment testing?
   - How to integrate RNA-seq for filtering?

3. STATISTICAL APPROACH:
   - What test for enrichment? (Fisher's exact? Binomial? Other?)
   - Multiple testing correction strategy?
   - How to handle multiple clusters/timepoints?

4. VALIDATION PLAN:
   - How do I know results are credible?
   - What are good positive controls?
   - What follow-up experiments would confirm findings?

5. INTERPRETATION:
   - What would "success" look like?
   - How to distinguish true drivers vs passengers?
   - What makes a TF finding "interesting" vs "expected"?
```

### ü§î Think About
- What are the biological assumptions in your workflow?
- Where could things go wrong?
- How would you validate unexpected findings?
- What would you do if results disagree with literature?

### ‚úÖ Success Criteria
- [ ] You have a step-by-step workflow with rationale for each step
- [ ] You've identified potential problems and solutions
- [ ] You have a validation strategy
- [ ] You can execute at least part of the workflow (with example data)
- [ ] You understand biological interpretation of expected outputs

### üéì Advanced Challenge
Ask the agent to:
1. Critique your workflow - what might be improved?
2. Generate actual code for key steps
3. Help you create a methods section draft
4. Suggest relevant papers to cite

## Exercise 4: Critical Evaluation

**Time**: 25-30 minutes  
**Difficulty**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Advanced

### üìö Background
Computational predictions are hypotheses, not facts. You must validate and understand limitations.

### üéØ Your Goal
Learn to critically evaluate motif matching results.

### üí° Starter Prompt
```
I ran motifmatchr and predicted 100 TFs bind to my peaks. 
Help me critically evaluate these results:

1. VALIDATION STRATEGY:
   - I have ChIP-seq for 5 of these TFs. How do I compare?
   - What metrics should I calculate? (precision, recall, F1?)
   - How do I define a "true positive"?
   - Write code to perform this validation

2. INTERPRET PERFORMANCE:
   - If precision is 30%, is that good, acceptable, or poor?
   - Why might it be impossible to get 90% precision?
   - What if precision varies widely across the 5 TFs?

3. IDENTIFY SYSTEMATIC BIASES:
   - Which types of TFs might be predicted poorly? Why?
   - How does peak quality affect accuracy?
   - Are there genomic regions where method fails?

4. IMPROVE PREDICTIONS:
   - Can I filter false positives using RNA-seq expression?
   - Would adding DNase footprinting help?
   - Should I adjust p-value thresholds per TF family?
   - What about ensemble approaches?

5. BIOLOGICAL REALITY:
   - Even with ChIP-seq "ground truth", what might we be missing?
   - Why might a predicted site without ChIP peak still be real?
   - Why might a ChIP peak without motif still be meaningful?
```

### ü§î Think About
- What does it mean if a TF's motif is present but ChIP-seq shows no binding?
- What does it mean if ChIP-seq shows binding but no motif is present?
- How do you balance false positives vs false negatives for your research question?
- When do you trust predictions enough to do experiments?

### ‚úÖ Success Criteria
- [ ] You can design and execute a validation experiment
- [ ] You understand what validation can and cannot tell you
- [ ] You've identified method limitations for your use case
- [ ] You have strategies to improve predictions
- [ ] You can interpret results in biological context

### üéì Advanced Challenge
"Compare motifmatchr to an alternative method (e.g., FIMO) on the same data. Which performs better? Why? When might the alternative be preferred?"

## Bonus Exercise: Teaching Others

**Time**: 20 minutes  
**Difficulty**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Teaching is learning!)

### üéØ Your Goal
Solidify your understanding by teaching someone else (or explaining to AI agent).

### üí° Activity
Ask the AI agent to roleplay as a confused student:

```
Act as a biology PhD student who is confused about [TOPIC YOU LEARNED]. 
I'm going to explain it to you. Ask me clarifying questions like a 
real student would. Push back if my explanation isn't clear. Help me 
refine my explanation.

Topic I'm teaching: [e.g., "Why p-value threshold matters for motif matching"]
```

### ‚úÖ Success Criteria
- [ ] You can explain without looking at notes
- [ ] You can answer "why" questions
- [ ] You can give examples and analogies
- [ ] You can identify when you still have gaps in understanding
