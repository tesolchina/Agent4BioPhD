Gene regulatory network inference in the era of single-cell multi-omics,Pau Badia-i-Mompel, Lorna Wessels, Sophia Müller-Dott, Rémi Trimbour, Ricardo O. Ramirez Flores, Ricard Argelaguet, Julio Saez-Rodriguez,2023,Nature Reviews Genetics,The interplay between chromatin; transcription factors and genes generates complex regulatory circuits that can be represented as gene regulatory networks (GRNs). The study of GRNs is useful to understand how cellular identity is established; maintained and disrupted in disease. GRNs can be inferred from experimental data — historically; bulk omics data — and/or from the literature. The advent of single-cell multi-omics technologies has led to the development of novel computational methods that leverage genomic; transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility information to infer GRNs at an unprecedented resolution. Here; we review the key principles of inferring GRNs that encompass transcription factor–gene interactions from transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility data. We focus on the comparison and classification of methods that use single-cell multimodal data. We highlight challenges in GRN inference; in particular with respect to benchmarking; and potential further developments using additional data modalities.,gene regulatory networks, GRN inference, single-cell multi-omics, transcription factors, chromatin accessibility, transcriptomics, ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, systematic review
