## Title

# **AI Agents for Bioinformatics Research: Automating Literature Analysis and Computational Workflows**

## Abstract

This workshop demonstrates how IDE-embedded AI agents can revolutionize bioinformatics research by seamlessly integrating literature analysis with computational tasks. Using a real-world example from gene regulatory network research (Badia-i-Mompel et al., 2023, Nature Reviews Genetics), we will explore how AI agents can automate both textual and programming workflows within a unified development environment.

### Workshop Highlights:

• **Intelligent Literature Mining**: Leverage `litstudy` (https://github.com/NLeSC/litstudy) to automate systematic literature reviews and citation network analysis

• **Domain-Specific Tool Integration**: Explore bioinformatics tools like `motifmatchr` (https://github.com/GreenleafLab/motifmatchr) for transcription factor binding motif analysis

• **Unified Workflow Automation**: Learn how AI agents can read scientific papers, extract computational methods, and generate executable code without context-switching

• **Hands-On Analysis**: Work through a complete workflow from literature review to bioinformatics analysis, demonstrating AI-assisted research capabilities

• **Reproducible Research**: Create automated pipelines that bridge the gap between literature understanding and computational implementation

### Case Study Focus:

We will use the paper "Gene regulatory network inference in the era of single-cell multi-omics" as our starting point to demonstrate:
- Automated extraction of computational methods and tools from literature
- Integration of literature analysis tools (`litstudy`) with domain-specific packages
- AI-assisted code generation for bioinformatics workflows
- Creating reproducible research pipelines with minimal manual coding

**Target Audience:** Bioinformatics researchers, computational biologists, PhD students, and anyone interested in leveraging AI to accelerate research workflows. Basic familiarity with biological concepts helpful but no programming experience required.

**Prerequisites:** Participants should create a GitHub account and fork the workshop repository (https://github.com/tesolchina/Agent4BioPhD) in advance.
