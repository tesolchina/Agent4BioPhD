# AI Agents for Bioinformatics Research: Automating Literature Analysis and Computational Workflows

This workshop demonstrates how IDE-embedded AI agents can streamline bioinformatics research by integrating literature analysis with computational tasks. Using Badia-i-Mompel et al. (2023) on gene regulatory networks as a case study, participants will learn to automate systematic literature reviews with litstudy and perform transcription factor binding analysis using motifmatchr. The session shows how AI agents can read scientific papers, extract computational methods, and generate executable code within a unified environment, eliminating context-switching between reading and coding tasks.
