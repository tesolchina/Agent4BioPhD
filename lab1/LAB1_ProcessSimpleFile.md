# Lab 1: Process a Simple File

## Lab: Process a Simple File

### Input: 
- File path: `lab1/data/sample_text.txt`
- File path: `lab1/data/example_data.csv`

### Process: 
Instructions for AI agents on how to process the input:

1. **Read and Analyze Text File**:
   - Read the content of `lab1/data/sample_text.txt`
   - Count the number of words, sentences, and paragraphs
   - Identify the most common words (excluding common stop words)
   - Generate a summary of the content
   - Extract any key terms or concepts mentioned

2. **Process CSV File**:
   - Read the CSV file `lab1/data/example_data.csv`
   - Display the structure: number of rows, columns, column names
   - Calculate basic statistics for numeric columns (mean, median, min, max)
   - Identify any missing values
   - Generate a brief summary report

3. **Create Output Files**:
   - Save text analysis results to `lab1/practice/text_analysis.txt`
   - Save CSV analysis results to `lab1/practice/csv_analysis.txt`
   - Create a combined summary report in `lab1/practice/combined_report.txt`

4. **Demonstrate AI Agent Capabilities**:
   - Show how the agent can read multiple files simultaneously
   - Demonstrate automatic code generation for file processing
   - Show error handling if files are missing or malformed

### Output: 
Designate folder path (and file paths) where the output could be delivered:

- Folder: `lab1/practice/`
  - `text_analysis.txt` - Analysis results of the text file
  - `csv_analysis.txt` - Analysis results of the CSV file
  - `combined_report.txt` - Combined summary report

### Reflection Notes: 
What we learn through this lab:

- **File I/O Operations**: Learn how AI agents can read and process different file formats (text, CSV)
- **Data Analysis**: See how agents can automatically generate code for basic data analysis tasks
- **Code Generation**: Observe how agents create working code from natural language instructions
- **Error Handling**: Understand how agents handle edge cases and errors
- **Multi-file Processing**: Experience how agents maintain context across multiple files
- **Output Generation**: Learn how agents organize and structure output files

**Key Takeaways**:
- AI agents can quickly generate file processing code without manual typing
- Agents understand context and can work with multiple files simultaneously
- Generated code is usually well-structured and includes error handling
- Agents can create comprehensive reports from simple instructions
- This foundation prepares us for more complex bioinformatics file processing tasks
