## Hypothesis Generation

Based on the research questions above, we can formulate testable hypotheses:

### Example 1: Data Integration Hypothesis
**Hypothesis**: Integrating chromatin accessibility data (ATAC-seq) with gene expression (RNA-seq) will improve the precision of transcription factor-target gene predictions by at least 25% compared to using expression data alone.

**Rationale**: Chromatin accessibility provides direct evidence of regulatory potential, reducing false positives from correlation-based inference.

**Testing approach**: 
- Use datasets with both modalities
- Compare precision-recall curves
- Validate predictions with ChIP-seq data

### Example 2: Cell-Type Specificity Hypothesis
**Hypothesis**: Gene regulatory networks exhibit greater topological differences between cell types than temporal changes within the same cell type during differentiation.

**Rationale**: Cell identity is fundamentally defined by distinct regulatory programs.

**Testing approach**:
- Infer GRNs across multiple cell types and time points
- Quantify network similarity using graph metrics
- Statistical comparison of between vs. within cell-type variation

### Example 3: Method Performance Hypothesis
**Hypothesis**: Causal inference methods will show superior performance in predicting regulatory directionality compared to correlation-based methods when validated with perturbation screens.

**Rationale**: Causal methods explicitly model regulatory direction, while correlation captures association without directionality.

**Testing approach**:
- Apply multiple methods to the same dataset
- Validate predictions using CRISPR perturbation data
- Compare accuracy in predicting upstream vs. downstream effects

## Experimental Design Considerations

For each research question, consider:

1. **Data requirements**: Type of single-cell data needed, sample size, sequencing depth
2. **Computational resources**: Memory, processing power, runtime estimates
3. **Validation strategies**: How to assess the biological validity of findings
4. **Controls**: Appropriate negative and positive controls
5. **Reproducibility**: Documentation and code sharing practices

## Next Steps

After generating research questions:

1. **Literature review**: Check if questions have been addressed
2. **Feasibility assessment**: Evaluate data availability and technical requirements
3. **Collaboration**: Identify potential collaborators with relevant expertise
4. **Funding**: Align questions with grant opportunities
5. **Pilot studies**: Design small-scale experiments to test hypotheses

## Conclusion

AI agents can accelerate the brainstorming process by:
- Systematically exploring multiple research directions
- Generating diverse questions across different categories
- Connecting concepts from literature to novel hypotheses
- Structuring thoughts in a logical, organized manner

This approach helps researchers move quickly from literature reading to actionable research plans.
