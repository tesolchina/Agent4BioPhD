## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the Python examples, you'll need:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

### Running Examples

1. **Text-based examples** (brainstorming, literature, writing):
   - Simply open and read the markdown files
   - Use them as templates for your own work
   - Adapt the content to your specific research context

2. **Python scripts** (analysis, code):
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the repository root
   cd Agent4BioPhD
   
   # Run analysis example
   python examples/analysis/grn_analysis.py
   
   # Run visualization example
   python examples/code/data_visualization.py
   ```

## How AI Agents Help

These examples demonstrate how AI agents can:

1. **Speed up research**: Automate repetitive tasks and analysis pipelines
2. **Improve quality**: Generate comprehensive, well-structured content
3. **Enhance reproducibility**: Create detailed documentation and code
4. **Facilitate learning**: Provide examples and explanations of complex methods
5. **Support creativity**: Generate diverse ideas and approaches

## Customizing for Your Research

Each example can be adapted to your specific research project:

- **Brainstorming**: Replace the reference article with your own research topic
- **Literature**: Add methods or tools relevant to your field
- **Analysis**: Modify scripts to work with your data format
- **Writing**: Adjust templates to match your journal's requirements
- **Code**: Extend visualizations for your specific needs
