### Title: Enhanced Gene Regulatory Network Inference from Sparse Single-Cell Data Using Multi-Modal Integration

**Abstract (250 words)**

Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are fundamental to understanding cellular behavior, but inferring accurate networks from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data remains challenging due to data sparsity and technical noise. While existing methods have shown promise, they typically rely solely on transcriptomic data, potentially missing regulatory relationships evident in other molecular layers. Here, we present MultiGRN, a novel computational framework that integrates scRNA-seq with single-cell ATAC-seq data to improve GRN inference accuracy. 

Our method employs a multi-task learning architecture that simultaneously learns gene expression patterns and chromatin accessibility profiles, explicitly modeling the relationship between transcription factor binding and target gene expression. We incorporate prior knowledge of transcription factor binding motifs and use attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different regulatory signals. 

We benchmarked MultiGRN against six state-of-the-art methods using synthetic datasets and three real biological systems with extensive ChIP-seq validation data. MultiGRN achieved 30% higher precision and 25% higher recall compared to single-modality methods, with particularly strong performance in identifying context-specific regulatory relationships. Analysis of developing mouse embryos revealed 127 cell-type-specific regulatory relationships that were not detected by existing methods, including key regulators of lineage commitment validated by subsequent CRISPR perturbation experiments.

Our results demonstrate that integrating chromatin accessibility substantially improves GRN inference from sparse single-cell data. MultiGRN is implemented as an open-source Python package with comprehensive documentation and is applicable to any dataset with matched scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq profiles. This work advances our ability to decode regulatory programs governing cellular identity and behavior.

### Title: Cell-Type-Specific Regulatory Networks Reveal Master Regulators of Cancer Stem Cell Plasticity

**Abstract (280 words)**

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) drive tumor heterogeneity and therapy resistance through their ability to transition between stem-like and differentiated states, a process governed by gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Despite their clinical importance, the cell-type-specific regulatory programs controlling CSC plasticity remain poorly understood. Here, we performed single-cell multi-omics profiling of patient-derived glioblastoma cultures to map the regulatory networks underlying CSC state transitions.

We generated matched single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data from 45,000 cells across three patient samples, capturing CSCs in various functional states. Using a combination of correlation-based and machine learning methods, we inferred cell-type-specific GRNs and identified transcription factors with differential regulatory activity between CSC and non-CSC populations. Network topology analysis revealed three master regulators—SOX2, OLIG2, and POU3F2—that formed a regulatory core maintaining the stem-like state, with their activity levels predicting patient survival outcomes.

Perturbation experiments using CRISPRi validated 89% of predicted regulatory relationships and demonstrated that combinatorial targeting of all three master regulators synergistically reduced CSC frequency and tumor-initiating capacity. Time-resolved transcriptomic profiling following perturbation revealed a hierarchical cascade: SOX2 inhibition triggered immediate transcriptional changes, followed by OLIG2-dependent effects, while POU3F2 regulated a delayed response program. Integration with patient survival data showed that high coordinated activity of this regulatory core correlated with poor prognosis and therapy resistance.

Our study provides a comprehensive map of regulatory networks governing CSC plasticity and identifies a master regulatory circuit as a potential therapeutic vulnerability. The hierarchical organization of this circuit suggests that temporally coordinated targeting strategies may be more effective than simultaneous inhibition. More broadly, our approach demonstrates how single-cell multi-omics and network inference can reveal actionable therapeutic targets in cancer.

### Title: SCENIC+: Extending Single-Cell Regulatory Network Inference with Temporal and Spatial Information

**Abstract (230 words)**

Understanding how gene regulatory networks control dynamic cellular processes requires integrating temporal and spatial information with traditional expression-based network inference. Current methods for inferring regulatory networks from single-cell data, such as SCENIC, excel at identifying transcription factor regulons but do not explicitly model temporal dynamics or spatial context. We developed SCENIC+, an extension that incorporates pseudotime trajectories and spatial coordinates to infer context-dependent regulatory relationships.

SCENIC+ uses a probabilistic framework to model how transcription factor activity varies along developmental trajectories and across spatial locations. The method first constructs a base network using co-expression and motif analysis, then employs Gaussian processes to model smooth changes in regulatory activity over pseudotime and space. This approach identifies regulons that are specifically active during certain developmental stages or in particular tissue regions.

We validated SCENIC+ using spatial transcriptomics data from developing mouse brain and time-series scRNA-seq from differentiating embryonic stem cells. Compared to static network inference methods, SCENIC+ detected 40% more biologically validated regulatory relationships and correctly predicted the timing of transcription factor activation during differentiation. In spatial data, SCENIC+ identified region-specific regulons that govern tissue patterning, validated by known developmental markers.

SCENIC+ is available as an open-source Python package compatible with standard single-cell analysis workflows. By incorporating temporal and spatial dimensions, SCENIC+ enables more accurate and interpretable regulatory network inference from modern single-cell multi-modal datasets.

### Title: A Comprehensive Benchmark of Gene Regulatory Network Inference Methods for Single-Cell Data

**Abstract (260 words)**

Gene regulatory network (GRN) inference from single-cell RNA sequencing data has become a central goal in systems biology, with numerous computational methods developed in recent years. However, choosing the most appropriate method for a given dataset and biological question remains challenging due to limited systematic comparisons. Here, we present a comprehensive benchmark of 25 GRN inference methods evaluated on 12 datasets spanning multiple organisms, tissues, and experimental designs.

We established a benchmarking framework that evaluates methods based on multiple criteria: accuracy (validated against ChIP-seq and perturbation data), scalability (computational time and memory), robustness (performance across different datasets), and interpretability (ease of biological interpretation). Each method was evaluated using standardized preprocessing and consistent evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, and F1 score for network topology, as well as concordance with known biological pathways.

Our results reveal substantial variation in method performance depending on dataset characteristics. Regression-based methods (SCENIC, GRNBoost2) showed the best overall balance of accuracy and scalability, while causal inference methods excelled when perturbation data was available. Machine learning methods achieved the highest precision but required large training datasets. Importantly, we found that combining predictions from multiple methods using ensemble approaches improved accuracy by up to 20% over individual methods.

Based on these findings, we provide practical recommendations for method selection and present a user-friendly web portal where researchers can explore benchmark results interactively. Our benchmark framework is extensible and will be regularly updated as new methods emerge. This resource will help researchers make informed decisions about GRN inference methods and accelerate progress in understanding gene regulation.
