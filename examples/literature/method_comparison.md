# Comparison of GRN Inference Methods

This document demonstrates how AI agents can help organize and compare different methods discussed in scientific literature, specifically from the Badia-i-Mompel et al. (2023) review.

## Overview of GRN Inference Approaches

Based on the review article, GRN inference methods can be categorized into several major classes:

## 1. Correlation-Based Methods

- ✓ Easy to interpret
- ✓ Works well with bulk RNA-seq data
- ✓ Minimal assumptions about regulatory mechanisms

### Limitations
- ✗ Cannot distinguish direct from indirect relationships
- ✗ Cannot infer regulatory directionality
- ✗ Sensitive to confounding factors
- ✗ May produce many false positives

### Best Use Cases
- Initial exploratory analysis
- Identifying co-regulated gene modules
- Large-scale screening for candidate relationships
- When computational resources are limited

- Cell-type-specific network inference

## 3. Information Theory Methods

### Description
These methods use mutual information and related metrics to quantify statistical dependencies between genes.

### Best Use Cases
- Non-linear regulatory relationships
- Post-transcriptional regulation
- Complex feedback loops
- When non-parametric approaches are preferred

## 4. Bayesian Network Methods

### Description
These methods use probabilistic graphical models to represent dependencies between genes and infer the most likely network structure.

### Representative Tools
- **BANJO** (Bayesian Network Inference with Java Objects)
- **BTNET** (Bayesian Temporal Network)
- **dynGENIE3** (dynamic GENIE3)

### Advantages
- ✓ Principled probabilistic framework
- ✓ Can incorporate prior knowledge
- ✓ Provides uncertainty estimates
- ✓ Handles time-series data

### Limitations
- ✗ Computationally very expensive
- ✗ Requires strong assumptions
- ✗ Difficult to scale to genome-wide networks
- ✗ May be trapped in local optima

### Best Use Cases
- Time-series or longitudinal data
- When prior knowledge is available
- Smaller, focused networks
- When uncertainty quantification is needed

## 5. Machine Learning and Deep Learning Methods

### Description
These methods leverage modern ML/DL architectures to learn complex patterns in gene expression data.

### Representative Tools
- **GRNBoost2** (gradient boosting)
- **DeepSEM** (structural equation modeling with deep learning)
- **CNNC** (Convolutional Neural Network for Co-expression)
- **Transformer-based models**

### Advantages
- ✓ Can capture complex non-linear patterns
- ✓ State-of-the-art performance on benchmarks
- ✓ Can integrate multiple data types
- ✓ Scalable with proper implementation

### Limitations
- ✗ Requires large training datasets
- ✗ "Black box" nature limits interpretability
- ✗ Prone to overfitting
- ✗ Computationally intensive training

### Best Use Cases
- Large single-cell datasets (>10,000 cells)
- Multi-omics integration
- When predictive accuracy is paramount
- Transfer learning across datasets

## 6. Causal Inference Methods

### Description
These methods explicitly model causal relationships, going beyond correlation to identify regulatory causality.

### Representative Tools
- **CauseNet**
- **PCALG** (PC algorithm for causal discovery)
- **GES** (Greedy Equivalence Search)
- **Perturbation-based methods**

### Advantages
- ✓ Infers causal directionality
- ✓ Distinguishes correlation from causation
- ✓ Can integrate perturbation data
- ✓ Theoretically grounded

### Limitations
- ✗ Requires strong assumptions (e.g., acyclicity)
- ✗ Needs perturbation or time-series data
- ✗ Computationally expensive
- ✗ May not capture feedback loops

### Best Use Cases
- Perturbation screens (CRISPR, RNAi)
