3. KEY CONCEPTS AND CONTEXT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Transcription Factors:
  1. Here, we review the key principles of inferring GRNs that encompass transcription factor–gene interactions from transcriptomics and chromatin accessib...
  2. Transcription factors (TFs) bind to promoter regions and cis-regulatory elements (CREs), displacing nucleosomes and making the transcription start sit...
  3. A list of known transcription factor (TF) genes is obtained from other sources to distinguish genes with regulatory capabilities...

Gene Regulation:
  1. figure 1
a, Gene regulation and its key elements...
  2. Multiple components of gene regulation, such as TFs, splicing factors, long non-coding RNAs, microRNAs and metabolites, can be incorporated in GRNs...
  3. The inclusion and measurement of these other aspects of gene regulation has the potential to generate GRNs that better represent gene regulation in vi...

Single Cell:
  1. We focus on the comparison and classification of methods that use single-cell multimodal data...
  2. c, GRNs generated from single-cell omics data allow to understand cell type and state specificity, explain the progression of dynamic trajectories and...
  3. This limitation has been overcome by the use of single-cell technologies24,25, allowing the inference of GRNs across different cell types, differentia...

Chromatin Accessibility:
  1. Here, we review the key principles of inferring GRNs that encompass transcription factor–gene interactions from transcriptomics and chromatin accessib...
  2. For example, the inclusion of chromatin accessibility21 data allows to fine-tune TF–gene links by considering whether genes are open and by including ...
  3. Nevertheless, inference from transcriptomics data alone introduces false positives as many other mechanisms that are involved in gene regulation, such...


4. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WORKSHOP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  • Focus on ATAC-seq + RNA-seq integration (highly relevant)
  • Demonstrate motifmatchr for TF binding site prediction
  • Show how to combine expression and accessibility data
  • Discuss limitations of different GRN inference methods
  • Highlight importance of benchmarking
