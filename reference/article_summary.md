## Key Insights

1. **Single-cell resolution enables unprecedented detail**: Modern single-cell technologies allow researchers to study gene regulation at the individual cell level, revealing heterogeneity that was previously masked in bulk analyses.

2. **Multi-omics integration is crucial**: Combining different data types (transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics) provides a more complete picture of regulatory mechanisms.

3. **Computational challenges remain**: Despite advances, inferring accurate GRNs from noisy single-cell data remains challenging, requiring sophisticated statistical and machine learning methods.

4. **Benchmarking is essential**: Systematic evaluation of methods is needed to guide users in selecting appropriate tools for their specific research questions.

5. **Future directions**: Integration of spatial information, temporal dynamics, and perturbation data will further improve GRN inference.
