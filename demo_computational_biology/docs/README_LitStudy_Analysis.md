## 🔬 Research Context

### The Challenge
The field of Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) inference has exploded with the advent of single-cell multi-omics technologies. Badia-i-Mompel et al. (2023) provided a comprehensive qualitative review of this landscape, but quantitative bibliometric analysis can provide complementary insights.

### The Solution
Use **LitStudy** to perform systematic, reproducible literature analysis that:
- Validates the review's categorization
- Identifies collaboration networks
- Tracks temporal evolution
- Discovers research gaps
- Provides strategic guidance

### The Approach
A 12-section Jupyter notebook that combines:
- Multi-source data collection (Scopus, SemanticScholar, etc.)
- Statistical analysis (publication trends, author networks)
- Network analysis (citations, collaborations)
- Natural language processing (topic modeling)
- Method-specific deep dives
- Gap analysis and future directions

---

## 📊 Expected Deliverables

### Visualizations
- 📈 Publication timeline with technology milestones
- 🌐 Interactive co-citation and co-authorship networks
- ☁️ Topic word clouds (12 themes)
- 🗺️ Geographic distribution maps
- 📊 Method comparison charts

### Data Products
- 📋 Complete annotated bibliography (CSV)
- 🏆 Top 50 most cited papers
- 🔧 Method characteristics comparison table
- 🤝 Author collaboration matrices
- 📰 Venue statistics and recommendations

### Insights
- 🔍 Hidden gems (high-impact, under-cited papers)
- 🆕 Emerging themes not yet mainstream
- 🌍 Geographic and institutional patterns
- 📖 Venue-topic associations for publication strategy
- ❓ Research gaps and opportunities
