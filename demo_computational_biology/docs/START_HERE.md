### üéì **I'm a Student/Learner**

**Track A: Workshop Attendee (3 hours)**
1. Attend workshop (ask questions!)
2. Review `AI_Agent_Demo_Plan.md` for details you missed
3. Complete `Hands_On_Exercises.md` exercises 1-4
4. Apply to your own research (Exercise 5)

**Track B: Self-Paced Learner (4-6 hours)**
1. Read `AI_Agent_Demo_Plan.md` Phase 1-2 for foundation
2. Try `Hands_On_Exercises.md` Exercise 1-2
3. Read `AI_Agent_Demo_Plan.md` Phase 3 for applications
4. Try `Hands_On_Exercises.md` Exercise 3-4
5. Apply to your research (Exercise 5)

**Track C: Quick Orientation (30 minutes)**
1. Read `README.md` for philosophy
2. Skim `AI_Agent_Demo_Plan.md` to see scope
3. Try one exercise from `Hands_On_Exercises.md`
4. Decide if you want to go deeper

---

### üî¨ **I Want to Apply This to My Research**

**Immediate Application**:
1. Read Phase 3 of `AI_Agent_Demo_Plan.md` for workflow examples
2. Adapt prompts to your research question
3. Use `Hands_On_Exercises.md` Exercise 5 as template
4. Iterate with AI agent as collaborator

**What You Need**:
- Clear research question involving TF binding/motif analysis
- Data: ATAC-seq peaks, ChIP-seq, or similar
- Basic R knowledge (or willingness to learn)
- Access to AI agent (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Complete analysis workflow designed
- Code generated with biological context
- Validation strategy planned
- Results interpretable

---

### ü§î **I'm Skeptical About AI in Research**

Great! Critical thinking is essential. Start here:

1. **Read**: `README.md` section "What Makes This 'Agent' Rather Than 'Code Generator'?"
2. **Compare**: The table showing Agent vs Traditional approaches
3. **Try**: `Hands_On_Exercises.md` Exercise 1 (just 15 min)
4. **Evaluate**: Does this address your concerns?

**Key Points We Address**:
- AI can make mistakes ‚Üí We teach validation
- Students might become dependent ‚Üí We focus on understanding
- Biological rigor might suffer ‚Üí We emphasize critical evaluation
- Just code generation ‚Üí We integrate literature, reasoning, validation

**Still skeptical?** Good! That's the mindset we want. Try it with critical eye.

## The Big Picture

### What Is This Really About?

**Not**: "Let AI write your code"  
**Yes**: "Use AI to accelerate learning and research"

**Not**: "Replace biological thinking"  
**Yes**: "Amplify biological insight with computational tools"

**Not**: "Trust AI outputs blindly"  
**Yes**: "Collaborate with AI while maintaining critical evaluation"

### The Unique Value Proposition

Traditional approach to learning bioinformatics:
1. Read paper
2. Google for tools
3. Find random tutorial
4. Copy-paste code
5. Debug for hours
6. Still don't understand why it works

**AI Agent approach**:
1. Discuss paper with agent
2. Agent explains tools in context
3. Agent generates workflow with reasoning
4. You understand principles
5. You can adapt to new questions
6. You validate and interpret correctly

### Core Competencies You'll Develop

‚úÖ **Literature Integration**: Connect papers to implementations  
‚úÖ **Tool Selection**: Choose right methods for your question  
‚úÖ **Parameter Reasoning**: Understand biological meaning of settings  
‚úÖ **Workflow Design**: Build complete analysis pipelines  
‚úÖ **Critical Evaluation**: Validate computational predictions  
‚úÖ **Biological Interpretation**: Translate results to insights  
‚úÖ **Research Independence**: Tackle novel questions confidently

- Text editor/IDE

### Setup Instructions:
```bash
# Clone the motifmatchr repository
git clone https://github.com/GreenleafLab/motifmatchr.git

# In R, install required packages
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(c("motifmatchr", "GenomicRanges", 
                       "TFBSTools", "BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19"))

# Verify installation
library(motifmatchr)
data(example_motifs)
# If this works, you're ready!
```
