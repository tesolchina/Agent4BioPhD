# AI Agent for Bioinformatics Research: A motifmatchr Case Study

## Target Audience
Biology PhD students with programming experience who want to leverage AI agents for research beyond simple code generation.

## Overview
This document demonstrates how AI agents can accelerate bioinformatics research by connecting literature to implementation, exploring codebases, and developing computational thinking. We use **motifmatchr**, a transcription factor (TF) binding motif matching tool, as our case study, grounded in the principles described in Badia-i-Mompel et al. (2023) *Nature Reviews Genetics*.

## About motifmatchr

### What is motifmatchr?
**motifmatchr** is an R/Bioconductor package that wraps the MOODS C++ library for fast motif matching across many sequences and many motifs. It's designed for use cases like:
- Finding TF binding sites in ChIP-seq or ATAC-seq peaks
- Scanning regulatory regions for known motifs
- Integrating with gene regulatory network (GRN) inference workflows

### Scientific Context
In the landmark review paper by Badia-i-Mompel et al. (2023) "Gene regulatory network inference in the era of single-cell multi-omics," motifmatchr is highlighted (Box 1) as one of the key motif matcher algorithms used in modern GRN inference methods. The paper explains that:

> "Methods that leverage chromatin accessibility data split GRN inference into two steps: first, the assignment of TFs to gene regulatory elements (open chromatin regions, commonly referred to as peaks); and second, the assignment of these regulatory elements to genes."

For the first step, methods use **TF binding motif databases** and **motif matcher algorithms** (like motifmatchr) to predict where TFs bind.

```

#### 4.2 Extension: Integration with Expression Data
**Objective**: Move from binding prediction to activity inference

   - Calculate TF activity score per cell/sample
   - Compare to TF expression levels

3. **Biological validation**

   - Can you predict cell states from TF activities?
   - Do perturbation experiments validate predictions?

**Expected AI Agent Capabilities**:
- Connect multiple data modalities
- Implement published algorithms
- Interpret results in biological context
- Design validation experiments

**Example Prompt**:
```
"I want to extend motifmatchr analysis to infer TF activities. I have:

Help me:
1. Explain conceptually:
   - How to go from 'TF motif in peak' to 'TF activity in cell'
   - What methods exist? (SCENIC, chromVAR, Pando, etc.)
   - What assumptions are we making?

2. Implement simple TF activity scoring:
   - Link peaks to genes (let's use 50kb window)
   - For each TF motif: find target genes
   - Score TF activity as enrichment of targets in upregulated genes
   - Calculate per-cluster or per-cell scores

3. Write code for:
   - Peak-to-gene assignment
   - TF-target network construction
   - Activity scoring (multiple methods)
   - Visualization (TF activity heatmap across cell types)

4. Validation strategies:
   - Compare TF activity to TF expression (should correlate?)
   - Do high-activity TFs make biological sense?
   - How to experimentally test top candidates?

5. Compare our simple approach to published methods (chromVAR)

## Conclusion

This plan demonstrates that AI agents can be powerful research assistants when used thoughtfully. The key is moving beyond "write code for X" to "help me understand, design, implement, validate, and interpret X in biological context."

For biology PhD students, this approach:
- Accelerates literature-to-implementation
- Teaches computational thinking
- Maintains biological rigor
- Encourages critical evaluation
- Facilitates best practices
- Enables ambitious research questions

The goal is not to replace thinking, but to amplify it—allowing researchers to focus on biology while the agent handles technical details and suggests approaches they might not have considered.

*This plan is designed to be iterative. Start with simpler scenarios and progressively increase complexity as students become comfortable with the AI agent paradigm.*
