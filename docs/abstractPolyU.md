# **Leveraging AI Agents in Integrated Development Environments: A New Paradigm for Academic Research and Writing**

## Abstract

This workshop introduces IDE-embedded AI agents as a powerful alternative to browser-based AI interactions for academic research. Unlike traditional chatbots that require constant context-switching, AI agents within Integrated Development Environments can directly access, read, and edit project files, perform web searches, and generate code to automate research tasks.

### Key Takeaways:

• **Eliminate context-switching**: AI agents work directly within your project environment
• **Automate literature reviews**: Learn to use AI for systematic literature analysis and data collection
• **Generate research tools**: Create web crawlers and analysis scripts without programming experience
• **Streamline workflows**: Integrate AI assistance into existing research processes
• **Access advanced capabilities**: Leverage code generation for novel research methodologies

The workshop includes hands-on exploration of the "litstudy" repository https://github.com/NLeSC/litstud for literature analysis automation. No programming background required.

**Participants should create a GitHub account and fork the workshop repository (https://github.com/tesolchina/vibeCoding101) in advance.**

**Speaker:** Dr. Simon Wang, Lecturer in English and Innovation Officer, The Language Centre, Hong Kong Baptist University

**Date:** November 28th, 2025
**Time:** 10:30 AM - 12:30 PM
**Venue:** OEE1017 (On-campus)
