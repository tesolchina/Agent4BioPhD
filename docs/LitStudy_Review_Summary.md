## How the Plan Works

### Integration with Badia-i-Mompel et al. 2023

The paper provides a **qualitative review** of GRN inference methods covering:
- 20+ computational methods (Table 1)
- Technology evolution (bulk → single-cell → multi-omics)
- Methodological categorization (linear/non-linear, frequentist/Bayesian)
- Applications and validation strategies
- Challenges and future directions

Our **quantitative analysis** complements this by:

1. **Validating Claims**: 
   - "Explosion of novel methods" → Measure publication rate increase
   - "Key research groups" → Identify via co-authorship networks
   - "Seminal papers" → Confirm via citation analysis

2. **Extending Insights**:
   - Geographic patterns not discussed in review
   - Collaboration network structure
   - Hidden gems (important but under-cited)
   - Temporal evolution of specific themes

3. **Identifying Gaps**:
   - Under-studied topics via topic modeling
   - Missing validation types
   - Regional underrepresentation
   - Venue publication strategies

4. **Providing Evidence**:
   - Quantitative support for review's categorization
   - Data-driven recommendations
   - Objective method comparison metrics

### Workflow Example

```python
# 1. Collect papers on GRN methods
docs = search_scopus('("gene regulatory network") AND (inference)')

# 2. Enhance metadata
docs_refined, _ = refine_scopus(docs)

# 3. Filter to relevant time period
docs_sc = docs_refined.filter_docs(lambda d: d.publication_year >= 2015)

# 4. Analyze trends
plot_year_histogram(docs_sc)  # → Shows 2018-2020 boom

# 5. Find key researchers
plot_author_histogram(docs_sc, limit=20)  # → Identifies leaders

# 6. Build citation network
cocite_network = build_cocitation_network(docs_sc)
plot_network(cocite_network)  # → Reveals method families

# 7. Discover themes
corpus = build_corpus(docs_sc)
model = train_nmf_model(corpus, num_topics=12)
plot_topic_clouds(model)  # → Confirms paper's categorization

# 8. Identify gaps
recent = docs_sc.filter_docs(lambda d: d.publication_year >= 2022)
recent_corpus = build_corpus(recent)
# → Compare topics to find emerging themes
```
